When we grow apart it's destiny
it's just how it was
supposed to be
but I know that I'm not strong
enough to accept that so easily
Each and every single answer
that comes my way
are sold at too high a price
for me to pay
they rob me of the courage to
leave it all and move on
The song that I once sang
and gave to you
is now just a sad love song,
overplayed a time or two
Let the wind flow in and
blow it away
Back to that time, that summer
day when I fell in love with you
〈♪〉
When we draw near each other,
it's destiny too
the way it's supposed to unfold
through and through
If I could convince myself it
was meant to be,
maybe I wouldn't feel so alone
Each and every single answer
that comes my way
have way too many
hypocrisies to say
They erase the path that I need
to take to the other side
The song that I once sang
and gave to you
is now just a sad love song,
overplayed a time or two
Let the wind flow in and
blow it away
Back to the time, that summer
day when I fell in love with you
〈♪〉
If the past and future
both decide to disappear
Do you think
that then I'd be finally free
If I could pick one emotion
to do away with at last
If I picked my love for you,
would I be able to back
If I could one day hear
every song that you heard
Breathe everything you breathed,
feel everything you felt
If I could be your eyes and
see the world like you did then
maybe I could love you
the way I've always wanted to
