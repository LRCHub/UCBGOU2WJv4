[00:28.72] When we grow apart, it's destiny
[00:35.19] It's just how it was supposed to be
[00:38.63] But I know that I'm not strong enough to accept that so easily
[00:45.55] Each and every single answer that comes my way
[00:48.84] Are sold at too high a price for me to pay
[00:52.78] They rob me of the courage to leave it all and move on
[00:58.73] The song that I once sang and gave to you
[01:05.73] Its now just a sad love song, over played a time or two
[01:13.04] Let the wind flow in and blow it away
[01:19.80] Back to that time, that summer day when I fell in love with you
[01:54.78] When we draw near each other, its destiny too
[01:58.27] The way its suppose to unfold, through and through
[02:01.22] If I could convince myself it was meant to be
[02:04.83] Maybe I wouldn't feel so alone
[02:08.52] Each and every single answer that comes my way
[02:11.92] Have way too many hypocrisies to say
[02:15.50] They erase the path that I need to take to the other side
[02:21.51] The song that I once sang and gave to you
[02:28.13] Is now just a sad love song, over played a time or two
[02:35.77] Let the wind flow in and blow it away
[02:41.95] Back to that time
[02:44.52] That summer day when I fell in love with you
[03:16.22] If the past and future both decided to disappear
[03:23.18] Do you think that then I'd be finally free
[03:29.69] If I could pick one emotion to do away with at last
[03:36.90] If I picked my love for you would I be able to go back
[03:46.93] If I could one day hear every song that you heard
[03:53.76] Breathe everything you breathed, feel everything you felt
[04:00.76] If I could be your eyes and see the world like you did
[04:07.29] Then maybe I could love you
[04:17.82] The way I've always wanted to
